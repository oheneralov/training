Here is a comprehensive list of all ReactJS hooks, including the standard ones up to React 19 ( with descriptions and use cases:
1. useState()
Description: Adds state to functional components.
When to Use: Used when you need to manage and update state in functional components.
2. useEffect()
Description: Performs side effects in functional components. It replaces lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
When to Use: When you need to run code in response to changes in state or props, or to handle side effects such as data fetching.
3. useContext()
Description: Allows you to subscribe to React context without needing to use a context consumer component.
When to Use: When you need to access context values directly inside a functional component.
4. useReducer()
Description: An alternative to useState, used for more complex state logic.
When to Use: When managing state that depends on previous state values or involves more complex transitions (e.g., handling multiple actions).
5. useCallback()
Description: Returns a memoized version of a callback function that only changes if one of its dependencies has changed.
When to Use: When passing functions as props to child components that may trigger unnecessary re-renders.
6. useMemo()
Description: Memoizes a computed value, recomputing it only when its dependencies change.
When to Use: To optimize performance for expensive calculations or operations.
7. useRef()
Description: Returns a mutable object that persists for the lifetime of the component. Useful for referencing DOM elements or storing mutable values without triggering re-renders.
When to Use: When you need to persist values across renders without causing re-renders or for direct DOM manipulation.
8. useImperativeHandle()
Description: Customizes the instance value that is exposed when using ref in parent components.
When to Use: When you want to control what methods or properties are accessible to parent components through a ref.
9. useLayoutEffect()
Description: Similar to useEffect, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations.
When to Use: When you need to perform side effects that read or modify the DOM before the browser paints, such as measuring layout or performing animations.
10. useDebugValue()
Description: Displays a label for custom hooks in React DevTools for debugging purposes.
When to Use: For custom hooks that you want to provide more useful debugging information in React DevTools.
11. useTransition() (React 18)
Description: Allows you to mark certain updates as non-urgent, enabling React to keep the UI responsive during large updates.
When to Use: When you want to manage UI responsiveness during complex updates, such as when rendering large lists or performing expensive calculations.
12. useDeferredValue() (React 18)
•	Description: Lets you defer a value to prevent blocking updates from happening synchronously.
•	When to Use: When you want to delay rendering a value, such as in high-latency situations (e.g., slow network requests or large datasets).
13. useActionState() (React 19)
•	Description: Used to handle asynchronous form submissions, including states for pending, success, and error.
•	When to Use: Ideal for form submissions where you need to manage different states (loading, success, error).
14. useFormStatus() (React 19)
•	Description: Provides real-time form submission status, such as pending or the type of HTTP request being made.
•	When to Use: Used to show form submission status indicators (e.g., loading, success, error).
15. useOptimistic() (React 19)
•	Description: Handles optimistic UI updates by immediately updating the UI before a server response.
•	When to Use: Used for situations where immediate feedback is needed, such as optimistic rendering of data changes before confirmation from the server.
16. use() (React 19)
•	Description: Allows components to directly await promises and handle asynchronous operations seamlessly within the render cycle.
•	When to Use: When you want to handle asynchronous operations declaratively in your components (e.g., data fetching, async operations).
________________________________________
When to Use Each Hook:
•	State and Effect Hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer): Use these for managing state, side effects, or complex state transitions in your components.
•	Performance Optimization (useMemo, useCallback, useTransition): Use these to optimize rendering, prevent unnecessary re-renders, or prioritize updates in large applications.
•	Context Management (useContext): Use this to access global state or shared data across components.
•	Refs and DOM Manipulation (useRef, useImperativeHandle): Use these for direct DOM access or managing references in a component.
•	Debugging (useDebugValue): Use for debugging custom hooks and showing useful labels in the React DevTools.
•	Advanced State Handling (useOptimistic, useActionState, useFormStatus): Use these when managing asynchronous data, forms, or UI updates with real-time feedback.
These hooks give you greater control over state, side effects, and UI performance, making React functional components more powerful and flexible.

Sure! Here are examples for each React hook:
1. useState()
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);

return <button onClick={increment}>Count: {count}</button>;
2. useEffect()
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Component mounted or updated');
}, [count]);

return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
3. useContext()
const ThemeContext = createContext('light');

const Component = () => {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <div>Theme: {theme}</div>;
};
4. useReducer()
const initialState = { count: 0 };
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

return (
  <>
    <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
    <div>{state.count}</div>
  </>
);
5. useCallback()
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('Callback function');
}, []);

return <button onClick={memoizedCallback}>Click Me</button>;
6. useMemo()
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(count), [count]);

return <div>Expensive Value: {expensiveValue}</div>;
7. useRef()
const inputRef = useRef(null);

const focusInput = () => inputRef.current.focus();

return (
  <>
    <input ref={inputRef} />
    <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
  </>
);
8. useImperativeHandle()
const Child = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const localRef = useRef();

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus: () => {
      localRef.current.focus();
    },
  }));

  return <input ref={localRef} />;
});

const Parent = () => {
  const childRef = useRef();

  return (
    <>
      <Child ref={childRef} />
      <button onClick={() => childRef.current.focus()}>Focus Child Input</button>
    </>
  );
};
9. useLayoutEffect()
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  console.log('DOM is ready');
}, [count]);

return <div>{count}</div>;
10. useDebugValue()
const useCustomHook = (value) => {
  useDebugValue(value ? 'Value is true' : 'Value is false');
  return value;
};
11. useTransition() (React 18)
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

const handleClick = () => {
  startTransition(() => {
    setItems([...items, newItem]);
  });
};

return (
  <>
    {isPending ? <div>Loading...</div> : <div>Items Loaded</div>}
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Add Item</button>
  </>
);
12. useDeferredValue() (React 18)
const [value, setValue] = useState('');
const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);

return (
  <div>
    <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />
    <div>{deferredValue}</div>
  </div>
);
13. useActionState() (React 19)
const [state, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(async (prevState, formData) => {
  const response = await submitData(formData);
  return response.success ? { message: 'Success!' } : { error: 'Failed!' };
}, {});

return (
  <form action={submitAction}>
    <input name="data" />
    <button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>
      {isPending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
    {state?.message && <p>{state.message}</p>}
    {state?.error && <p>{state.error}</p>}
  </form>
);
14. useFormStatus() (React 19)
const { pending } = useFormStatus();

return <button disabled={pending}>{pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}</button>;
15. useOptimistic() (React 19)
const [likes, setLikes] = useOptimistic(initialLikes);

const handleClick = async () => {
  setLikes(likes + 1);
  const result = await likePost();
  if (!result.success) {
    setLikes(likes); // Revert optimistic update on failure
  }
};

return <button onClick={handleClick}>Likes: {likes}</button>;
16. use() (React 19)
const data = use(fetchData());

return <div>{data}</div>;
These are examples of how each of the React hooks can be used in a React component without detailed explanation.
